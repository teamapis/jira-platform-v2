  defaultWorkflow:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The name of the default workflow for the workflow scheme. The default
      workflow has *All Unassigned Issue Types* assigned to it in Jira. If
      `defaultWorkflow` is not specified when creating a workflow scheme, it is
      set to *Jira Workflow (jira)*.
  issueTypeMappings:

      type: string
    description: >-
      The issue type to workflow mappings, where each mapping is an issue type
      ID and workflow name pair. Note that an issue type can only be mapped to
      one workflow in a workflow scheme.

      For draft workflow schemes, this property is the name of the default
      workflow for the original workflow scheme. The default workflow has *All

      For draft workflow schemes, this property is the issue type to workflow
      mappings for the original workflow scheme, where each mapping is an issue
      type ID and workflow name pair. Note that an issue type can only be mapped
      to one workflow in a workflow scheme.

  updateDraftIfNeeded:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Whether to create or update a draft workflow scheme when updating an
      active workflow scheme. An active workflow scheme is a workflow scheme
      that is used by at least one project. The following examples show how this
      property works:

       *  Update an active workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `true`: If a draft workflow scheme exists, it is updated. Otherwise, a draft workflow scheme is created.
       *  Update an active workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `false`: An error is returned, as active workflow schemes cannot be updated.
       *  Update an inactive workflow scheme with `updateDraftIfNeeded` set to `true`: The workflow scheme is updated, as inactive workflow schemes do not require drafts to update.

      Defaults to `false`.
