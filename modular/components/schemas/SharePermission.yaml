      The type of share permission:

       *  `user` Shared with a user.
       *  `group` Shared with a group. If set in a request, then specify `sharePermission.group` as well.
       *  `project` Shared with a project. If set in a request, then specify `sharePermission.project` as well.
       *  `projectRole` Share with a project role in a project. This value is not returned in responses. It is used in requests, where it needs to be specify with `projectId` and `projectRoleId`.
       *  `global` Shared globally. If set in a request, no other `sharePermission` properties need to be specified.
       *  `loggedin` Shared with all logged-in users. Note: This value is set in a request by specifying `authenticated` as the `type`.
       *  `project-unknown` Shared with a project that the user does not have access to. Cannot be set in a request.
