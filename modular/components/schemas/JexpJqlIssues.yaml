  The JQL specifying the issues available in the evaluated Jira expression under
  the `issues` context variable. Not all issues returned by the JQL query are
  loaded, only those described by the `startAt` and `maxResults` properties. To
  determine whether it is necessary to iterate to ensure all the issues returned
  by the JQL query are evaluated, inspect `meta.issues.jql.count` in the
  response.
