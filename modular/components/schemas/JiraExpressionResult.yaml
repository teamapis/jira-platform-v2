      The value of the evaluated expression. It may be a primitive JSON value or
      a Jira REST API object. (Some expressions do not produce any meaningful
      results—for example, an expression that returns a lambda function—if
      that's the case a simple string representation is returned. These string
      representations should not be relied upon and may change without notice.)
