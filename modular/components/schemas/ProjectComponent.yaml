  assigneeType:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The nominal user type used to determine the assignee for issues created
      with this component. See `realAssigneeType` for details on how the type of
      the user, and hence the user, assigned to issues is determined. Can take
      the following values:

       *  `PROJECT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the project the component is in.
       *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the component.
       *  `UNASSIGNED` an assignee is not set for issues created with this component.
       *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the default assignee for the project that the component is in.

      Default value: `PROJECT_DEFAULT`.  

      Optional when creating or updating a component.
    enum:
      - PROJECT_DEFAULT
      - COMPONENT_LEAD
      - PROJECT_LEAD
      - UNASSIGNED
  assignee:
    description: >-
      The details of the user associated with `assigneeType`, if any. See
      `realAssignee` for details of the user assigned to issues created with
      this component.
    readOnly: true

  realAssigneeType:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The type of the assignee that is assigned to issues created with this
      component, when an assignee cannot be set from the `assigneeType`. For
      example, `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but no component lead
      is set. This property is set to one of the following values:

       *  `PROJECT_LEAD` when `assigneeType` is `PROJECT_LEAD` and the project lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.
       *  `COMPONENT_LEAD` when `assignee`Type is `COMPONENT_LEAD` and the component lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.
       *  `UNASSIGNED` when `assigneeType` is `UNASSIGNED` and Jira is configured to allow unassigned issues.
       *  `PROJECT_DEFAULT` when none of the preceding cases are true.

  isAssigneeTypeValid:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Whether a user is associated with `assigneeType`. For example, if the
      `assigneeType` is set to `COMPONENT_LEAD` but the component lead is not
      set, then `false` is returned.
