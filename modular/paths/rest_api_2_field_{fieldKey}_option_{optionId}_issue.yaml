  summary: Replace issue field option
  description: >-
    Deselects an issue-field select-list option from all issues where it is
    selected. A different option can be selected to replace the deselected
    option. The update can also be limited to a smaller set of issues by using a
    JQL query.


    Connect and Forge app users with *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) can override the
    screen security configuration using `overrideScreenSecurity` and
    `overrideEditableFlag`.


    This is an [asynchronous operation](#async). The response object contains a
    link to the long-running task.


    Note that this operation **only works for issue field select list options
    added by Connect apps**, it cannot be used with issue field select list
    options created in Jira or using operations from the [Issue custom field
    options](#api-group-Issue-custom-field-options) resource.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg). Jira permissions are
    not required for the app providing the field.

        The field key is specified in the following format:
        **$(app-key)\_\_$(field-key)**. For example,
        *example-add-on\_\_example-issue-field*. To determine the `fieldKey`
        value, do one of the following:

         *  open the app's plugin descriptor, then **app-key** is the key at the top and **field-key** is the key in the `jiraIssueFields` module. **app-key** can also be found in the app listing in the Atlassian Universal Plugin Manager.
         *  run [Get fields](#api-rest-api-2-field-get) and in the field details the value is returned in `key`. For example, `"key": "teams-add-on__team-issue-field"`
