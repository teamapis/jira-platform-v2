  summary: Find users and groups
  description: >-
    Returns a list of users and groups matching a string. The string is used:

     *  for users, to find a case-insensitive match with display name and e-mail address. Note that if a user has hidden their email address in their user profile, partial matches of the email address will not find the user. An exact match is required.
     *  for groups, to find a case-sensitive match with group name.

    For example, if the string *tin* is used, records with the display name
    *Tina*, email address *sarah@tinplatetraining.com*, and the group
    *accounting* would be returned.


    Optionally, the search can be refined to:

     *  the projects and issue types associated with a custom field, such as a user picker. The search can then be further refined to return only users and groups that have permission to view specific:
        
         *  projects.
         *  issue types.
        
        If multiple projects or issue types are specified, they must be a subset of those enabled for the custom field or no results are returned. For example, if a field is enabled for projects A, B, and C then the search could be limited to projects B and C. However, if the search is limited to projects B and D, nothing is returned.
     *  not return Connect app users and groups.
     *  return groups that have a case-insensitive match with the query.

    The primary use case for this resource is to populate a picker field
    suggestion list with users or groups. To this end, the returned object
    includes an `html` field for each list. This field highlights the matched
    query term in the item name with the HTML strong tag. Also, each list is
    wrapped in a response object that contains a header for use in a picker,
    specifically *Showing X of Y matching groups*.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.
