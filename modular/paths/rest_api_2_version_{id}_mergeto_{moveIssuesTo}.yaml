  summary: Merge versions
  description: >-
    Merges two project versions. The merge is completed by deleting the version
    specified in `id` and replacing any occurrences of its ID in `fixVersion`
    with the version ID specified in `moveIssuesTo`.


    Consider using [ Delete and replace
    version](#api-rest-api-2-version-id-removeAndSwap-post) instead. This
    resource supports swapping version values in `fixVersion`,
    `affectedVersion`, and custom fields.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) or *Administer
    Projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
    for the project that contains the version.
