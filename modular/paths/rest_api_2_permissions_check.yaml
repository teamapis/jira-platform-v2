  summary: Get bulk permissions
  description: >-
    Returns:

     *  for a list of global permissions, the global permissions granted to a user.
     *  for a list of project permissions and lists of projects and issues, for each project permission a list of the projects and issues a user can access or manipulate.

    If no account ID is provided, the operation returns details for the logged
    in user.


    Note that:

     *  Invalid project and issue IDs are ignored.
     *  A maximum of 1000 projects and 1000 issues can be checked.
     *  Null values in `globalPermissions`, `projectPermissions`, `projectPermissions.projects`, and `projectPermissions.issues` are ignored.
     *  Empty strings in `projectPermissions.permissions` are ignored.

    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) to check the
    permissions for other users, otherwise none. However, Connect apps can make
    a call from the app server to the product to obtain permission details for
    any user, without admin permission. This Connect app ability doesn't apply
    to calls made using AP.request() in a browser.
