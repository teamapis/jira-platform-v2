  summary: Get workflow scheme project associations
  description: >-
    Returns a list of the workflow schemes associated with a list of projects.
    Each returned workflow scheme includes a list of the requested projects
    associated with it. Any team-managed or non-existent projects in the request
    are ignored and no errors are returned.


    If the project is associated with the `Default Workflow Scheme` no ID is
    returned. This is because the way the `Default Workflow Scheme` is stored
    means it has no ID.
