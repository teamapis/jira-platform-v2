  summary: Bulk create issue
  description: >-
    Creates upto **50** issues and, where the option to create subtasks is
    enabled in Jira, subtasks. Transitions may be applied, to move the issues or
    subtasks to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue
    properties set.


    The content of each issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`.
    The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the
    [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-2-issue-createmeta-get). These
    are the same fields that appear on the issues' create screens.


    Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

     *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-2-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
     *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create
    issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
    the project in which each issue or subtask is created.
