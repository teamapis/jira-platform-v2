  summary: Get draft workflow scheme
  description: >-
    Returns the draft workflow scheme for an active workflow scheme. Draft
    workflow schemes allow changes to be made to the active workflow schemes:
    When an active workflow scheme is updated, a draft copy is created. The
    draft is modified, then the changes in the draft are copied back to the
    active workflow scheme. See [Configuring workflow
    schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more information.  

    Note that:

     *  Only active workflow schemes can have draft workflow schemes.
     *  An active workflow scheme can only have one draft workflow scheme.
