  summary: Get IDs of deleted worklogs
  description: >-
    Returns a list of IDs and delete timestamps for worklogs deleted after a
    date and time.


    This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per page. Each
    page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the number of items in the
    date range exceeds 1000, `until` indicates the timestamp of the youngest
    item on the page. Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the next page of
    worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the last page of
    worklogs.


    This resource does not return worklogs deleted during the minute preceding
    the request.
