  summary: Get contents metadata for an expanded attachment
  description: >-
    Returns the metadata for the contents of an attachment, if it is an archive.
    For example, if the attachment is a ZIP archive, then information about the
    files in the archive is returned. Currently, only the ZIP archive format is
    supported.


    Use this operation if you are processing the data without presenting it to
    the user, as this operation only returns the metadata for the contents of
    the attachment. Otherwise, to retrieve data to present to the user, use [
    Get all metadata for an expanded
    attachment](#api-rest-api-2-attachment-id-expand-human-get) which also
    returns the metadata for the attachment itself, such as the attachment's ID
    and name.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** For the issue containing the
    attachment:

     *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
