    ### About project roles ###


    [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible
    way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list
    of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can
    have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have
    the same membership throughout all Jira applications).


    Project roles are used in [permission
    schemes](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification
    schemes](#api-rest-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security
    levels](#api-rest-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment
    visibility](#api-rest-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.


    #### Members and actors ####


    In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an *actor*. An
    *actor* is a group or user associated with a project role.


    Actors may be set as [default
    members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole)
    of the project role or set at the project level:

     *  Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
     *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to assign a user to different roles in different projects.

    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

  summary: Create project role
  description: >-
    Creates a new project role with no [default
    actors](#api-rest-api-2-resolution-get). You can use the [Add default actors
    to project role](#api-rest-api-2-role-id-actors-post) operation to add
    default actors to the project role after creating it.


    *Note that although a new project role is available to all projects upon
    creation, any default actors that are associated with the project role are
    not added to projects that existed prior to the role being created.*<
