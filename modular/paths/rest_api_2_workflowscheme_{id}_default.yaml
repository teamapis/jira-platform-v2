    Sets the default workflow for a workflow scheme.


    Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow scheme
    is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` in the request object and a
    draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the new default workflow.
    The draft workflow scheme can be published in Jira.

  summary: Delete default workflow
  description: >-
    Resets the default workflow for a workflow scheme. That is, the default
    workflow is set to Jira's system workflow (the *jira* workflow).


    Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow scheme
    is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` and a draft workflow scheme
    is created or updated with the default workflow reset. The draft workflow
    scheme can be published in Jira.
