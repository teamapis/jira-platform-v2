  description: >-
    Assigns an issue type scheme to a project.


    If any issues in the project are assigned issue types not present in the new
    scheme, the operation will fail. To complete the assignment those issues
    must be updated to use issue types in the new scheme.


    Issue type schemes can only be assigned to classic projects.
