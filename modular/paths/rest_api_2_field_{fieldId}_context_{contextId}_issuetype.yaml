    - Issue custom field contexts
  summary: Add issue types to context
  description: >-
    Adds issue types to a custom field context, appending the issue types to the
    issue types list.


    A custom field context without any issue types applies to all issue types.
    Adding issue types to such a custom field context would result in it
    applying to only the listed issue types.


    If any of the issue types exists in the custom field context, the operation
    fails and no issue types are added.
