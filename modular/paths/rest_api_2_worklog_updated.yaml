  summary: Get IDs of updated worklogs
  description: >-
    Returns a list of IDs and update timestamps for worklogs updated after a
    date and time.


    This resource is paginated, with a limit of 1000 worklogs per page. Each
    page lists worklogs from oldest to youngest. If the number of items in the
    date range exceeds 1000, `until` indicates the timestamp of the youngest
    item on the page. Also, `nextPage` provides the URL for the next page of
    worklogs. The `lastPage` parameter is set to true on the last page of
    worklogs.


    This resource does not return worklogs updated during the minute preceding
    the request.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira,
    however, worklogs are only returned where either of the following is true:

     *  the worklog is set as *Viewable by All Users*.
     *  the user is a member of a project role or group with permission to view the worklog.
