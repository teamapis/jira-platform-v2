    Returns the value of a preference of the current user.


    Note that these keys are deprecated:

     *  *jira.user.locale* The locale of the user. By default this is not set and the user takes the locale of the instance.
     *  *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default this is not set and the user takes the timezone of the instance.

    Use [ Update a user

    from the user management REST API to manage timezone and locale instead.

     *  *user.keyboard.shortcuts.disabled* Whether keyboard shortcuts are disabled. Defaults to `false`.
     *  *user.autowatch.disabled* Whether the user automatically watches issues they create or add a comment to. By default, not set: the user takes the instance autowatch setting.
