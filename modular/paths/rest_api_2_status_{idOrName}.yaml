  summary: Get status
  description: >-
    Returns a status. The status must be associated with an active workflow to
    be returned.


    If a name is used on more than one status, only the status found first is
    returned. Therefore, identifying the status by its ID may be preferable.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.
