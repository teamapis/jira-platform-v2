  summary: Create issue link
  description: >-
    Creates a link between two issues. Use this operation to indicate a
    relationship between two issues and optionally add a comment to the from
    (outward) issue. To use this resource the site must have [Issue
    Linking](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yoXKM) enabled.


    This resource returns nothing on the creation of an issue link. To obtain
    the ID of the issue link, use
    `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/[linked issue
    key]?fields=issuelinks`.


    If the link request duplicates a link, the response indicates that the issue
    link was created. If the request included a comment, the comment is added.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

     *  *Browse project* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for all the projects containing the issues to be linked,
     *  *Link issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) on the project containing the from (outward) issue,
     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
     *  If the comment has visibility restrictions, belongs to the group or has the role visibility is restricted to.
