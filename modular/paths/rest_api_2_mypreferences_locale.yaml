    Returns the locale for the user.


    If the user has no language preference set (which is the default setting) or
    this resource is accessed anonymous, the browser locale detected by Jira is
    returned. Jira detects the browser locale using the *Accept-Language* header
    in the request. However, if this doesn't match a locale available Jira, the
    site default locale is returned.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.
