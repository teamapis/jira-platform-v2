  summary: Remove custom field context from projects
  description: >-
    Removes a custom field context from projects.


    A custom field context without any projects applies to all projects.
    Removing all projects from a custom field context would result in it
    applying to all projects.


    If any project in the request is not assigned to the context, or the
    operation would result in two global contexts for the field, the operation
    fails.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
