        The account IDs of the users for which emails are required. An
        `accountId` is an identifier that uniquely identifies the user across
        all Atlassian products. For example, `5b10ac8d82e05b22cc7d4ef5`. Note,
        this should be treated as an opaque identifier (that is, do not assume
        any structure in the value).
