  summary: Set issue types for workflow in workflow scheme
  description: >-
    Sets the issue types for a workflow in a workflow scheme. The workflow can
    also be set as the default workflow for the workflow scheme. Unmapped issues
    types are mapped to the default workflow.


    Note that active workflow schemes cannot be edited. If the workflow scheme
    is active, set `updateDraftIfNeeded` to `true` in the request body and a
    draft workflow scheme is created or updated with the new workflow-issue
    types mappings. The draft workflow scheme can be published in Jira.
