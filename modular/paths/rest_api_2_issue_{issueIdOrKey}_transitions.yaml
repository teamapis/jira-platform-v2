  summary: Get transitions
  description: >-
    Returns either all transitions or a transition that can be performed by the
    user on an issue, based on the issue's status.


    Note, if a request is made for a transition that does not exist or cannot be
    performed on the issue, given its status, the response will return any empty
    transitions list.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required: A list or transition is returned
    only when the user has:**

     *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

    However, if the user does not have the *Transition issues* [ project
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) the response will not
    list any transitions.
