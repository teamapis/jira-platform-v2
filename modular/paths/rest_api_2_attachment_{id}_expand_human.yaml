  summary: Get all metadata for an expanded attachment
  description: >-
    Returns the metadata for the contents of an attachment, if it is an archive,
    and metadata for the attachment itself. For example, if the attachment is a
    ZIP archive, then information about the files in the archive is returned and
    metadata for the ZIP archive. Currently, only the ZIP archive format is
    supported.


    Use this operation to retrieve data that is presented to the user, as this
    operation returns the metadata for the attachment itself, such as the
    attachment's ID and name. Otherwise, use [ Get contents metadata for an
    expanded attachment](#api-rest-api-2-attachment-id-expand-raw-get), which
    only returns the metadata for the attachment's contents.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** For the issue containing the
    attachment:

     *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
