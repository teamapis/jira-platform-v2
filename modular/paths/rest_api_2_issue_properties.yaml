    - Issue properties
  summary: Bulk set issues properties by list
  description: >-
    Sets or updates a list of entity property values on issues. A list of up to
    10 entity properties can be specified along with up to 10,000 issues on
    which to set or update that list of entity properties.


    The value of the request body must be a
    [valid](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627), non-empty JSON. The maximum
    length of single issue property value is 32768 characters. This operation
    can be accessed anonymously.


    This operation is:

     *  transactional, either all properties are updated in all eligible issues or, when errors occur, no properties are updated.
     *  [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the response to determine the status of the task and use [Get task](#api-rest-api-2-task-taskId-get) to obtain subsequent updates.

    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

     *  *Browse projects* and *Edit issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project containing the issue.
     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
