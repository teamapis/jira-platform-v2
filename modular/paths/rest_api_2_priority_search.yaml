  summary: Search priorities
  description: >-
    Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of priorities. The list can contain
    all priorities or a subset determined by any combination of these criteria:

     *  a list of priority IDs. Any invalid priority IDs are ignored.
     *  whether the field configuration is a default. This returns priorities from company-managed (classic) projects only, as there is no concept of default priorities in team-managed projects.

    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira.
