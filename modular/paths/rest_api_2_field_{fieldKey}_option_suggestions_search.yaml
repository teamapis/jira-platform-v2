        The field key is specified in the following format:
        **$(app-key)\_\_$(field-key)**. For example,
        *example-add-on\_\_example-issue-field*. To determine the `fieldKey`
        value, do one of the following:

         *  open the app's plugin descriptor, then **app-key** is the key at the top and **field-key** is the key in the `jiraIssueFields` module. **app-key** can also be found in the app listing in the Atlassian Universal Plugin Manager.
         *  run [Get fields](#api-rest-api-2-field-get) and in the field details the value is returned in `key`. For example, `"key": "teams-add-on__team-issue-field"`
