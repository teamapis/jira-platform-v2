    Returns reference data for JQL searches. This is a downloadable version of
    the documentation provided in [Advanced searching - fields
    reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/gwORLQ) and [Advanced
    searching - functions reference](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/hgORLQ),
    along with a list of JQL-reserved words. Use this information to assist with
    the programmatic creation of JQL queries or the validation of queries built
    in a custom query builder.


    To filter visible field details by project or collapse non-unique fields by
    field type then [Get field reference data
    (POST)](#api-rest-api-2-jql-autocompletedata-post) can be used.

    This operation can filter the custom fields returned by project. Invalid
    project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored. System fields are always returned.


    It can also return the collapsed field for custom fields. Collapsed fields
    enable searches to be performed across all fields with the same name and of
    the same field type. For example, the collapsed field `Component -
    Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component - cf[10061]` and
    `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched simultaneously.
