  summary: Update permission scheme
  description: >-
    Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things to note when
    using this resource:

     *  If a permissions list is present in the request, then it is set in the permission scheme, overwriting *all existing* grants.
     *  If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
     *  Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

    If you want to add or delete a permission grant instead of updating the
    whole list, see [Create permission
    grant](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post) or [Delete
    permission scheme
    entity](#api-rest-api-2-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-permissionId-delete).


    See [About permission schemes and
    grants](../api-group-permission-schemes/#about-permission-schemes-and-grants)
    for more details.
