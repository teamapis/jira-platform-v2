        options include:

         *  `sharedUsers` Returns the users that the filter is shared with. This includes users that can browse projects that the filter is shared with.

  summary: Remove filter as favorite
  description: >-
    Removes a filter as a favorite for the user. Note that this operation only
    removes filters visible to the user from the user's favorites list. For
    example, if the user favorites a public filter that is subsequently made
    private (and is therefore no longer visible on their favorites list) they
    cannot remove it from their favorites list.
