  summary: Get dashboard item property
  description: >-
    Returns the key and value of a dashboard item property.


    A dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific information to a user
    dashboard. Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can
    add to their dashboards. For more information on how users do this, see
    [Adding and customizing gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).


    When an app creates a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the
    dashboard item ID. The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or,
    where the item is configurable, the user edits the item. The app then uses
    this resource to store the item's content or configuration details. For more
    information on working with dashboard items, see [ Building a dashboard item
    for a JIRA Connect
    add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/guide-building-a-dashboard-item-for-a-jira-connect-add-on-33746254/)

    of the System dashboard. The System dashboard is considered to be shared
    with all other users, and is accessible to anonymous users when Jiraâ€™s
    anonymous access is permitted.
