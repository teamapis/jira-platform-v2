  summary: Load project avatar
  description: >-
    Loads an avatar for a project.


    Specify the avatar's local file location in the body of the request. Also,
    include the following headers:

     *  `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` To prevent XSRF protection blocking the request, for more information see [Special Headers](#special-request-headers).
     *  `Content-Type: image/image type` Valid image types are JPEG, GIF, or PNG.

    For example:  

    `curl --request POST `


    `--user email@example.com:<api_token> `


    `--header 'X-Atlassian-Token: no-check' `


    `--header 'Content-Type: image/< image_type>' `


    `--data-binary "<@/path/to/file/with/your/avatar>" `


    `--url
    'https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/project/{projectIdOrKey}/avatar2'`


    The avatar is cropped to a square. If no crop parameters are specified, the
    square originates at the top left of the image. The length of the square's
    sides is set to the smaller of the height or width of the image.


    The cropped image is then used to create avatars of 16x16, 24x24, 32x32, and
    48x48 in size.


    After creating the avatar use [Set project
    avatar](#api-rest-api-2-project-projectIdOrKey-avatar-put) to set it as the
    project's displayed avatar.
