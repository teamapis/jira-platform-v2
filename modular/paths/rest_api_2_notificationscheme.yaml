    ### About notification schemes ###


    A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive
    notifications for those events. The list is contained within the
    `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and
    `notifications`:

     *  `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
     *  `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:
        
         *  `CurrentAssignee`
         *  `Reporter`
         *  `CurrentUser`
         *  `ProjectLead`
         *  `ComponentLead`
         *  `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
         *  `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
         *  `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
         *  `EmailAddress`
         *  `AllWatchers`
         *  `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
         *  `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

    *Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in
    responses.*


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access Jira, however
    the user must have permission to administer at least one project associated
    with a notification scheme for it to be returned.
