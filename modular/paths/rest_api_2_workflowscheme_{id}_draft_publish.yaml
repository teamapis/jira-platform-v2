  summary: Publish draft workflow scheme
  description: >-
    Publishes a draft workflow scheme.


    Where the draft workflow includes new workflow statuses for an issue type,
    mappings are provided to update issues with the original workflow status to
    the new workflow status.


    This operation is [asynchronous](#async). Follow the `location` link in the
    response to determine the status of the task and use [Get
    task](#api-rest-api-2-task-taskId-get) to obtain updates.
