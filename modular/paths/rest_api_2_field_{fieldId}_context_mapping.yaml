  summary: Get custom field contexts for projects and issue types
  description: >-
    Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of project and issue type mappings
    and, for each mapping, the ID of a [custom field
    context](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/k44fOw) that applies to the
    project and issue type.


    If there is no custom field context assigned to the project then, if
    present, the custom field context that applies to all projects is returned
    if it also applies to the issue type or all issue types. If a custom field
    context is not found, the returned custom field context ID is `null`.


    Duplicate project and issue type mappings cannot be provided in the request.


    The order of the returned values is the same as provided in the request.

    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
