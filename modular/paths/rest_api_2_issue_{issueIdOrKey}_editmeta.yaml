  summary: Get edit issue metadata
  description: >-
    Returns the edit screen fields for an issue that are visible to and editable
    by the user. Use the information to populate the requests in [Edit
    issue](#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueIdOrKey-put).


    This endpoint will check for these conditions:


    1.  Field is available on a field screen - through screen, screen scheme,
    issue type screen scheme, and issue type scheme configuration.
    `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

    2.  Field is visible in the [field
    configuration](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/change-a-field-configuration/).
    `overrideScreenSecurity=true` skips this condition.

    3.  Field is shown on the issue: each field has different conditions here.
    For example: Attachment field only shows if attachments are enabled.
    Assignee only shows if user has permissions to assign the issue.

    4.  If a field is custom then it must have valid custom field context,
    applicable for its project and issue type. All system fields are assumed to
    have context in all projects and all issue types.

    5.  Issue has a project, issue type, and status defined.

    6.  Issue is assigned to a valid workflow, and the current status has
    assigned a workflow step. `overrideEditableFlag=true` skips this condition.

    7.  The current workflow step is editable. This is true by default, but [can
    be disabled by
    setting](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
    the `jira.issue.editable` property to `false`. `overrideEditableFlag=true`
    skips this condition.

    8.  User has [Edit issues
    permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/).

    9.  Workflow permissions allow editing a field. This is true by default but
    [can be
    modified](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/use-workflow-properties/)
    using `jira.permission.*` workflow properties.


    Fields hidden using [Issue layout settings
    page](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-field-layout-in-the-issue-view/)
    remain editable.


    Connect apps having an app user with *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), and Forge apps
    acting on behalf of users with *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg), can return
    additional details using:

     *  `overrideScreenSecurity` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if fields are available through screens, and field configuration (conditions 1. and 2. from the list above).
     *  `overrideEditableFlag` When this flag is `true`, then this endpoint skips checking if workflow is present and if the current step is editable (conditions 6. and 7. from the list above).

    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

     *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project that the issue is in.
     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.

    Note: For any fields to be editable the user must have the *Edit issues*
    [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the
    issue.
