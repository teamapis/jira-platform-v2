  summary: Get valid project name
  description: >-
    Checks that a project name isn't in use. If the name isn't in use, the
    passed string is returned. If the name is in use, this operation attempts to
    generate a valid project name based on the one supplied, usually by adding a
    sequence number. If a valid project name cannot be generated, a 404 response
    is returned.
