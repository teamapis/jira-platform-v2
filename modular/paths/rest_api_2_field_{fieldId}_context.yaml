  summary: Get custom field contexts
  description: >-
    Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of [
    contexts](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/what-are-custom-field-contexts-991923859.html)
    for a custom field. Contexts can be returned as follows:

     *  With no other parameters set, all contexts.
     *  By defining `id` only, all contexts from the list of IDs.
     *  By defining `isAnyIssueType`, limit the list of contexts returned to either those that apply to all issue types (true) or those that apply to only a subset of issue types (false)
     *  By defining `isGlobalContext`, limit the list of contexts return to either those that apply to all projects (global contexts) (true) or those that apply to only a subset of projects (false).
