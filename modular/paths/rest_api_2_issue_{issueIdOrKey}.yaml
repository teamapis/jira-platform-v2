    Returns the details for an issue.


    The issue is identified by its ID or key, however, if the identifier doesn't
    match an issue, a case-insensitive search and check for moved issues is
    performed. If a matching issue is found its details are returned, a 302 or
    other redirect is **not** returned. The issue key returned in the response
    is the key of the issue found.


    This operation can be accessed anonymously.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

     *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
